# 📊 Training Results & Performance Graphs

The following plots show how the YOLO model performed during training.  
These graphs include loss curves, precision, recall, and mAP metrics.

### 🔹 Complete Training Graphs
![Training Results](runs/train/exp/results.png)

### 📌 What the Graphs Mean

- **train/box_loss** → How accurately bounding boxes were learned  
- **train/cls_loss** → How well the model learned object classes  
- **train/dfl_loss** → Precision of bounding box edges  
- **val/box_loss / val/cls_loss / val/dfl_loss** → Performance on unseen data  
- **precision(B)** → How many predictions were correct  
- **recall(B)** → How many real objects were found  
- **mAP50** → Model accuracy at IoU = 0.50  
- **mAP50–95** → Model accuracy across IoU 0.50–0.95 (harder metric)

### ⭐ Key Observations
- All training and validation losses decreased steadily  
- Precision and recall reached **>95%**  
- mAP50 remained stable around **0.95**  
- mAP50–95 reached **~0.85**, showing strong generalization  
- No signs of overfitting  

These performance curves confirm that the model is **well-trained**, **stable**, and **highly accurate**.
